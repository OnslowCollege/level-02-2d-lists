# Level 2 Programming: 2D Lists

## üß† Learning intentions

In this lesson, you will learn:

1. What a 2D list is
2. How to create a 2D list
3. How to access inner items in a 2D list
4. How to manage inner lists within an outer list

## üèÜ Success criteria

You will know that you have completed the learning when:

1. You have created at least **one** 2D list, containing at least one list.
2. You have accessed at least **one** 2D list's inner lists.
3. You have accessed at least **one** inner list item.
4. You have passed the tests for **at least**:
   - [``task_01.py``](task_01.py)
   - [``task_02.py``](task_02.py)
5. You have taken a screenshot of [``task_04.py``](task_04.py)'s output working properly.

## üìñ Lesson

A powerful feature of lists in Python is that they can store anything, including other lists. This is called **2D lists**.

Normal lists are 1D, or one-dimensional, because the items can be represented in a single line.

| | Index 0 | Index 1 | Index 2 |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **List 1** | Hubert | Dewford | Llewellyn |

See how the items move only across from left to right?

2D lists can be represented across and up-down.

| | Index 0 | Index 1 | Index 2 |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **List 1** | Hubert | Dewford | Llewellyn |
| **List 2** | Webbigail | Lena | Violet |
| **List 3** | Scrooge | Donald | Della |

### Creating a 2D list

To put a list inside another list, simply write the lists like normal but with each list embedded in a list that wraps the rest.

```python
duck_groups = [["Hubert", "Dewford", "Llewellyn"], ["Webbigail", "Lena", "Violet"], ["Scrooge", "Donald", "Della"]]
```

See how each indivdual list is contained within another set of ``[`` and ``]``? This is a list of lists!

### Accessing a list

You access list within a 2D list the same as accessing items within a 1D list.

For example, to get the first list containing ``Hubert``, ``Dewford``, and ``Llewellyn``:

```python
print(duck_groups[0]) # ['Hubert', 'Dewford', 'Llewellyn']
```

To access the items *within* a 2D list, you first access the inner list, and then access the item as usual.

For example, to access ``Llewellyn`` from ``duck_groups``:

```python
# 0 for the first list
# 2 for the third item in the first list
print(duck_groups[0][2]) # Llewellyn
```

### List functions in 2D

All of the functions you learnt in [List Functions](lists-03-functions.md) work exactly the same, both for modifying lists within lists **and** for modifying items.

#### Appending and removing a list

```python
# Appending a list
duck_groups.append(["Magica", "Flintheart", "John"])

# Removing the list
duck_groups.pop(-1)
```

#### Appending and removing items in inner lists

```python
# Appending to the first inner list
duck_groups[0].append("Gene")

# Removing the item from the first inner list
duck_groups[0].pop(0)
```

#### Merging lists

```python
# Note that the added list is also a 2D list
duck_groups = duck_groups + [["Magica", "Flintheart", "John"]]
```

#### Merging items into inner lists

```python
# Add items to the last inner list
duck_groups = duck_groups[-1] + ["Ma Beagle", "Mark Beaks"]
```

## üìù Instructions

Create a Python program (starting in ``task_01.py`` and ending in ``task_04.py``) that uses 2D lists.

Complete the tasks by writing your code **below** each set of comments.

Use the Tests tab to ensure your code works properly and meets the requirements of the tasks.
